:slug: about

I am a multitech hacker, a science buff and an Open Source evangelist. I write
C++, Python, Go, JavaScript and can speak Hindi, Marathi, Bengali and English. When
I'm not writing code or hacking on some device, I play the guitar, read or 
work out.

I'm fascinated by AI and Computer Vision and have been dabbling in Data Science
for some time now.
